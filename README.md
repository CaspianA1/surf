## Surf
A visual file browser for the terminal.

## How to use it:

- Press `enter` to start typing a command. Press enter again to run your command.
- The bottom status will say `navigation` or `command` depending on the mode you're in.
- Click a directory to move into it. The directory at the bottom will change accordingly.
- Drag a directory to move it somewhere else on screen.
- If you're not in command mode, pressing `q` will exit you out of `Surf`.

## Note:
- Running commands to change a directory do not affect your directory state (that's a consequence of `popen`). Click the `..` directory to move up instead.
